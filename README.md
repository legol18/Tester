# Tester
Simulation project for modeling metacommunity dynamics. Project is based on *Wang and Loreau* paper on "Biodiversity and ecosystem stability across scales in metacommunities" in *Ecology letters, Volume 19, Issue 5, May 2016, Pages 510â€“518*.

To check the preliminary results, please compile the linked executable:

*gfortran dvode_f90_m.f90 deterministic.f90 -o xx* (for deterministic trajectory calculations without Euler)

*gfortran det_euler.f90 -o xx* (for deterministic trajectory calculations with Euler)

*gfortran random.f90 xxxx.f90 -o xx* (for stochastic calculations - using Euler)

(please replace *gfortran* with your usual compiler id, *xxxx* by the file you would like to compile and let *xx* be the executable name.)

Steps to simulation:

1) Start with *deterministic.f90*. It generates system trajectories using *dvode_f90_m.f90*. It will give you a flavour of the species evolution.

2) Repeat the calculation with *det_euler.f90*. Compare the results as they should be identical.

3) ...
