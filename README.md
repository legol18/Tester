# Tester
Simulation project for modeling metacommunity dynamics.

Currently working on the comparison of different time factors accompanying the between species, between patch and the combined response random numbers. To be updated ...

To check the preliminary results, please compile the linked executable:
*gfortran random.f90 xxxx.f90 -o xx* (for instance, please replace *gfortran* with your usual compiler id, *xxxx* by the file you would like to compile and let *xx* be the executable name.)

Steps to simulation:
1) Start with *deterministic.f90* since it generates the system trajectories. It will give you a flavour of the species evolution.

2) To follow ...
